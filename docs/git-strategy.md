# Git Workflow and Branching Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the recommended Git workflow and branching strategy for the project. Following these guidelines will help maintain a clean, organized, and collaborative codebase.

## Branch Types
- **main**: The stable production branch. Only thoroughly tested and reviewed code is merged here.
- **develop**: The integration branch for features and fixes. All development happens here before being merged to `main`.
- **feature/**: Used for developing new features. Branch off from `develop`.
- **bugfix/**: Used for fixing bugs. Branch off from `develop`.
- **hotfix/**: Used for urgent fixes to production. Branch off from `main` and merge back to both `main` and `develop`.
- **release/**: Used to prepare a new production release. Branch off from `develop` and merge into `main` and `develop` after release.

## Workflow Rules
1. **Clone the repository** and create a new branch for your work:
   ```sh
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Commit frequently** with clear, descriptive messages.
3. **Push your branch** to the remote repository regularly.
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to merge your branch into `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes).
5. **Request code review** from team members before merging.
6. **Resolve conflicts** and ensure all tests pass before merging.
7. **Delete merged branches** from the remote repository to keep it clean.

## Example Branch Names
- `feature/login-page`
- `bugfix/fix-navbar`
- `hotfix/critical-bug`
- `release/v1.2.0`

## Additional Guidelines
- Keep branches focused on a single purpose.
- Rebase or merge `develop` into your branch regularly to avoid large conflicts.
- Do not commit build artifacts, secrets, or files listed in `.gitignore`.

By following this strategy, the team can collaborate efficiently and maintain a high-quality codebase.
